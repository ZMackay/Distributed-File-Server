# Distributed-File-Server(JAVA)

This was the final project for my distributed systems class that me and other classmates collabortated to complete.

This system utilizes sockets and concurrency in order to create a smooth interaction between 
Client<->MasterServer<->DataServer.

We multiple thread safe data structures and load balancing techniques to create a well functioning system.
